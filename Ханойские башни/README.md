# The Tower of Hanoi

This is a graphical Tower of Hanoi solver that I made after we did a proof about the puzzle in my discrete math class. The GUI is made using Tkinter.

All the Tower of Hanoi logic is in `hanoi.py`, while the GUI is in `hanoi_gui.py`. `hanoi.py` can be run on its own on the command line, but to use the graphical program, make sure `hanoi_gui.py` and `hanoi.py` are in the same folder, and then run `hanoi_gui.py`.
